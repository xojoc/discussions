            <em>As a software developer I need to constantly keep up with what's going on in my field and community.
                Feeling overwhelmed with constant updates and failing to find relevant blogs to add to my feed reader,
                I decided to build something to keep me updated and find relevant discussions of my peers on Hacker
                News,
                Lobsters,
                Reddit, etc.</em>
