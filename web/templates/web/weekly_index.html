        <p class="font-italic">
            As a software developer I need to costantly keep up with what's going on in my field and community.
            Feeling overwhelmed with costant updates and failing to find relevant blogs to add to my feed reader,
            I decided to build something to keep me updated and find discussions happening on Hacker News, Lobsters,
            Reddit, etc.
